          <h3>Place Bet</h3>
          <p>Enter a valid amount in the field ‚ÄúAmount‚Äù .<br />
            Drag the slider until you reach the desired win chance and payout. There is a circle with the colored sectors to make the evaluation of your chances easier.<br />
            After everything is settled press "Roll" and ‚Ä¶ good luck!</p>          <ul>

            <li>Green gives you a x14 payout.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>As a player, your first task is to decide whether you believe the result of the roll will be 'over' (purple&nbsp;button)&nbsp;or 'under' (green button)&nbsp;a particular number.<br />
            You can adjust this number and the corresponding payout multiplier by dragging the payout line slider. The riskier your prediction (that is, choosing a smaller sector), the higher your potential win!<br />
            Your potential win amount is calculated by multiplying your bet amount by the payout multiplier. This means that the higher the payout multiplier, the more you stand to win if your prediction is correct.<br />
            Win amount is rounded down to two decimal places</p>

          <h3>Min &amp; Max Multiplier</h3>
          <p>Min multiplier is x1.01<br />
            Max multiplier is x32.50</p>


          <h3>Rounds History</h3>
          <p>At the top of the game screen you can see the result of the previous game rounds. Colorful outcomes stand for winning rounds, grey - for losing ones.</p>

          <h3>RTP</h3>
          <p>Game relies on a coefficient called 'RTP' (Return to Player), which is the statistical average of payouts over billions of rounds.<br />
            Please note that due to rounding down, the RTP may vary depending on the bet size.<br />
            With a bet of '1.0', the minimum RTP is 97.06%. When betting '0.1', the RTP can decrease to as low as 89.10%</p>
